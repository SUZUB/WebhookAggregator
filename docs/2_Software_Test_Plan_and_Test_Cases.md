## 2. Introduction & Executive Summary

### 2.1 Objectives
The primary objective of this Software Test Plan is to define the testing strategy, verification methods, test environments, acceptance criteria, and specific test cases for the **Webhook Aggregator System (WACDP)**. Testing ensures that the ingestion engine, non-blocking buffering (`service_queue`), worker thread pool, precision scheduler, dispatcher with exponential backoff, and persistent failure logging satisfy all functional and non-functional requirements specified in `SRS-WACDP-2026-V1.0`.

### 2.2 System Background & Test Scope
The system operates as high-concurrency event-driven middleware. Core challenges under test include:
- High-volume asynchronous ingestion without dropping connections.
- Thread-safe coordination between the event loop, worker threads (4–64 threads), and dispatcher threads without lock contention or race conditions.
- Adherence to mathematical exponential backoff timing (`T_wait = 2^tries`) up to `MAX_RETRIES = 5` (1 initial attempt + 5 retries = 6 total attempts).
- Reliable asynchronous delivery with bounded retries and durable DLQ persistence when target endpoints become unreachable.

## 3. Test Items & Software Risk Issues (Section 3)

### 3.1 Test Items (Modules Under Test)
The following software components constitute the targets of verification in this test plan:
1. **TI-01: Ingestion API Gateway & Event Loop:** HTTP listener, JSON schema validator, token authenticator, and non-blocking task generator.
2. **TI-02: Concurrent Service Buffer (`service_queue`):** Thread-safe FIFO in-memory queue with mutex synchronization and condition variables.
3. **TI-03: Worker Thread Pool & Categorizer:** Task allocation logic, thread dispatching, payload transformation, and HMAC-SHA256 signature generator.
4. **TI-04: Scheduler & Timer Subsystem:** Timer handle registry, cron parser, callback executor, and recurring event arming mechanism.
5. **TI-05: Dispatcher & HTTP Connection Pool:** Outbound payload transmission, socket reuse, and response status inspector.
6. **TI-06: Exponential Backoff & Retry Engine:** Backoff calculation, retry loop counter, sleep scheduler, and terminal failure discriminator.
7. **TI-07: Persistent Dead Letter Storage (DLQ) & Audit Logger:** SQLite / file-based durable store, write-ahead append-only audit log, and sensitive data masking sanitizer.
8. **TI-08: Administrative Query API:** Endpoints for querying task status, viewing DLQ payloads, and issuing manual redrives.

### 3.2 Software Risk Analysis & Mitigation Matrix

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation & Testing Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RSK-01** | **Race Conditions & Mutex Deadlocks:** Multiple threads concurrently modifying `service_queue` or `scheduler_mapping` causing thread freeze. | Medium | Critical | Execute race-detection test suites using ThreadSanitizer (TSan); test worker pool scaling at 4, 16, 32, and 64 threads, separating client concurrency testing. |
| **RSK-02** | **Buffer Overflow & Memory Exhaustion:** High-rate upstream bursts saturating RAM buffer before dispatchers can drain payloads. | High | High | Implement hard memory bounds on `service_queue` (default 50,000 tasks, maximum 100,000 tasks) with active backpressure (HTTP 429) testing under peak simulated traffic. |
| **RSK-03** | **Endpoint Tarpitting / Socket Starvation:** Downstream endpoint hangs open connections, exhausting system file descriptors. | High | High | Enforce strict 5,000 ms socket read/write timeouts in HTTP client; verify timeout recovery in test harness. |
| **RSK-04** | **Timer Drift / Missed Callbacks:** Long-running callbacks blocking scheduler thread, delaying subsequent recurring webhooks. | Medium | Medium | Decouple timer event firing from callback execution by delegating callback tasks to worker pool; verify ± 10 ms precision (`NFR-03`). |
| **RSK-05** | **Silent Message Loss on Target Outage:** Unreachable downstream targets cause dropped webhooks without audit record. | Low | Critical | Execute fault-injection tests simulating complete network blackout; verify 100% DLQ persistence and append-only audit logging. |

### 4.2 Features Not to be Tested
1. **Target Endpoint Internal Business Logic:** The internal application behavior of downstream webhook consumers beyond HTTP status code generation.
2. **Third-Party Infrastructure Outages:** Public internet backbone outages or DNS provider infrastructure failures beyond boundary gateways.
3. **Hardware-Level Power Loss:** Physical power cycling of bare-metal test servers during non-durable in-flight microsecond memory transfer (handled by UPS/OS level).

### 5.1 Security Validation & Vulnerability Testing (Section 5.1)
In strict compliance with system verification requirements, Section 5.1 details the formal security validation strategy:

#### 5.1.1 HMAC-SHA256 Signature Validation & Tamper Detection
- **Objective:** Ensure outbound payloads cannot be modified in flight and downstream endpoints can definitively verify authenticity (`SEC-REQ-01`).
- **Validation Procedure:**
  1. Trigger webhook dispatch with test payload `{"event": "payment_completed", "amount": 100.50}` and known secret key `k_test_secret_99`.
  2. Capture outbound HTTP headers `X-Webhook-Signature` and `X-Webhook-Timestamp`.
  3. Recompute expected HMAC-SHA256 using standard test oracle. Assert bitwise match.
  4. Modify a single character in the payload body in a mock proxy. Re-evaluate signature.
  5. Assert signature verification FAILS on modified payload.

#### 5.1.2 Replay Attack Prevention & Timestamp Window Validation
- **Objective:** Prevent malicious actors from capturing valid signed webhooks and re-transmitting them later.
- **Validation Procedure:**
  1. Capture valid signed webhook request.
  2. Simulate downstream receiver verification with timestamp tolerance Δt = 300 seconds.
  3. Transmit payload with timestamp artificially set to T - 301 seconds.
  4. Verify verification rejects stale payload as expired.

#### 5.1.3 Ingestion Authentication & Token Boundary Testing
- **Objective:** Verify perimeter protection on `/api/v1/webhooks/ingest` (`SEC-REQ-02`).
- **Validation Procedure:**
  1. Send request with NO `Authorization` header. Expect HTTP 401 Unauthorized.
  2. Send request with malformed Bearer token (`Bearer invalid_garbage_token`). Expect HTTP 401 Unauthorized.
  3. Send request with expired JWT token. Expect HTTP 401 Unauthorized.
  4. Verify response latency is < 3 ms to ensure denial-of-service immunity on rejection.

#### 5.1.4 Rate Limiting & DoS Throttling Verification
- **Objective:** Verify token-bucket rate limiter prevents queue saturation (`SEC-REQ-02`).
- **Validation Procedure:**
  1. Generate burst of 1,200 requests within a 60-second window from a single API key (configured limit: 1,000 req/min).
  2. Assert first 1,000 requests return HTTP 202 Accepted.
  3. Assert subsequent 200 requests receive HTTP 429 Too Many Requests with `Retry-After: 60`.

#### 5.1.5 Sensitive Data Sanitization & Log Masking Validation
- **Objective:** Verify credentials and sensitive fields are never written to disk or audit logs (`SEC-REQ-04`).
- **Validation Procedure:**
  1. Ingest task with payload: `{"api_key": "secret_abc123", "password": "supersecretpassword", "data": "regular_info"}`.
  2. Force delivery failure to trigger DLQ persistence and audit logging.
  3. Read persisted disk record and audit log file directly.
  4. Assert string `secret_abc123` and `supersecretpassword` DO NOT appear anywhere on disk.
  5. Assert fields are replaced with `***REDACTED***`.

### 5.2 Unit & Component Testing
- Tests isolated modules in memory using mocking frameworks.
- Tests include: JSON schema validator, cron expression parser, exponential backoff timing math (T = 2^n), and bounded queue push/pop.
- Code coverage goal: ≥ 85% statement coverage.

### 5.3 Integration Testing
- Validates thread interactions between `Event Loop`, `service_queue`, `Worker Thread Pool`, `dispatch_queue`, and `Dispatcher Thread`.
- Uses a local mock HTTP server (WireMock / Python http.server) to simulate downstream endpoint responses (200 OK, 500 Internal Error, 503 Unavailable, Socket Drop).

### 5.4 Concurrency & Race Condition Verification
- Implemented in **C++20** and compiled with Clang/GCC sanitizer flags (`-std=c++20 -fsanitize=thread`).
- Worker pool elasticity evaluated across 4, 16, 32, and 64 worker threads rapidly popping from `service_queue` and pushing to `dispatch_queue` under a 50,000 task load. High client connection concurrency (up to 10,000 concurrent client requests) is isolated and stress-tested separately at the ingestion gateway.
- Verified condition: Zero race reports, zero deadlocks, zero orphaned tasks, and lock contention < 5% (`NFR-09`).

### 5.5 Stress, Load & Backpressure Testing
- Uses high-throughput load generators (k6 / Locust / wrk).
- Sustained load of 5,000 requests/sec for 10 minutes.
- Peak burst load of 15,000 requests/sec to verify graceful backpressure (HTTP 429/503) without server crash or unbounded memory growth.

### 5.6 Item Pass / Fail Criteria
- **Pass Criteria:**
  - 100% of Critical and High-severity test cases pass.
  - Ingestion p99 response time < 15 ms.
  - Zero data loss for failed webhooks (100% DLQ capture).
  - All security validation test cases pass with zero vulnerabilities.
- **Fail Criteria:**
  - Any unhandled thread crash, segmentation fault, or deadlock.
  - Drop of accepted webhook without DLQ recording.
  - Failure of exponential backoff timing by > 15%.

### 5.7 Suspension Criteria & Resumption Requirements
- **Suspension:** Testing is suspended if fatal crashes prevent server startup or corrupt shared queue memory.
- **Resumption:** Testing resumes when the blocking defect is resolved, verified by unit regression test, and deployed to test environment.

### 5.8 Test Deliverables
1. Software Test Plan (this document: `STP-WACDP-2026-V1.0`).
2. Test Execution Log & Coverage Report.
3. Defect Bug Reports logged in Jira under project `WACDP`.
4. Final Test Summary Report (TSR).

#### Test Case ID: `TC-SEC-04`
- **Title:** Validate Append-Only Audit Trail and JSON-Aware Recursive Secret Redaction
- **Associated Requirement:** `SEC-REQ-04`, `SEC-OBJ-02`
- **Test Type:** Security / Data Sanitization
- **Priority:** High (P1)
- **Pre-conditions:** Logging and DLQ subsystem configured to output to `/var/log/wacdp/audit.log` and SQLite DLQ database.
- **Test Input Data:** Deeply nested JSON payload containing credentials across objects and arrays:
  ```json
  {
    "event": "user.provisioned",
    "user": {
      "username": "operator1",
      "password": "supersecretpassword123",
      "credentials": {
        "access_token": "tok_live_998877",
        "secret": "top_secret_hmac_key"
      }
    },
    "tokens": [
      {"name": "session", "token": "sess_abcdef123456"},
      {"name": "backup", "api_key": "key_backup_987654"}
    ],
    "headers": {
      "authorization": "Bearer admin_super_token"
    },
    "public_data": {
      "account_id": "ACC-554433",
      "status": "ACTIVE"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Step-by-Step Execution Procedure:**
  1. Submit task with above nested JSON payload to ingestion endpoint.
  2. Force delivery failure to trigger DLQ persistence and audit logging.
  3. Inspect raw text of `/var/log/wacdp/audit.log` and SQLite DLQ database record (`payload_body`).
  4. Verify that the JSON-aware recursive sanitizer walks all nested objects and array elements.
- **Expected Result:**
  - Audit log is opened in append-only mode (`O_APPEND`).
  - None of the plaintext secret values (`supersecretpassword123`, `tok_live_998877`, `top_secret_hmac_key`, `sess_abcdef123456`, `key_backup_987654`, `admin_super_token`) appear anywhere in the database or log file.
  - Every sensitive field value (`password`, `access_token`, `secret`, `token`, `api_key`, `authorization`) is strictly replaced with `***REDACTED***`.
  - Non-sensitive fields (`username`, `account_id`, `status`, `event`) remain intact with valid JSON formatting.
- **Actual Result / Status:** TBD / Not Executed

### 10.4 End-to-End Resilience Test Case

#### Test Case ID: `TC-E2E-01`
- **Title:** Full Lifecycle: Ingestion, Worker Allocation, Intermittent Downstream Failure, Exponential Backoff Recovery, and DLQ Isolation
- **Associated Requirement:** `FR-01`, `FR-03`, `FR-07`, `FR-08`, `FR-09`, `FR-11`
- **Test Type:** End-to-End (E2E) System Integration
- **Priority:** Critical (P0)
- **Pre-conditions:** Full system running; mock downstream server running with programmable behavior.
- **Test Input Data:**
  - Task 1 (Transient Failure): Mock server returns 503 on attempts 1-2, then returns 200 on attempt 3.
  - Task 2 (Permanent Failure): Mock server returns 500 on all attempts.
- **Step-by-Step Execution Procedure:**
  1. Submit Task 1 and Task 2 simultaneously to ingestion endpoint.
  2. Verify immediate HTTP 202 responses for both.
  3. Observe Task 1:
     - Attempt 0 (Initial Dispatch): Fails (HTTP 503) → waits 1s.
     - Retry 1: Fails (HTTP 503) → waits 2s.
     - Retry 2: Succeeds (HTTP 200) → marked `DELIVERED`.
  4. Observe Task 2:
     - Attempt 0 (Initial Dispatch) fails (HTTP 500).
     - Retries 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 fail (HTTP 500) with delays 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s.
     - Reaches `MAX_RETRIES = 5` (6 total attempts) → marked `FAILED` → stored in DLQ table.
  5. Admin queries `/api/v1/webhooks/failed`. Verify Task 2 is listed.
  6. Admin restarts mock server to healthy state and triggers `/api/v1/webhooks/{task_2_id}/retry`.
  7. Verify Task 2 is successfully re-delivered.
- **Expected Result:**
  - Task 1 successfully recovers and delivers via exponential backoff.
  - Task 2 cleanly transitions to DLQ after 6 total attempts (1 initial + 5 retries) without system disruption.
  - Admin redrive successfully delivers Task 2.
- **Actual Result / Status:** TBD / Not Executed
